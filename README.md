HaskellNet-SSL
--------------

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dpwright/HaskellNet-SSL.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dpwright/HaskellNet-SSL)

This package ties together the excellent [HaskellNet][HaskellNet] and
[connection][connection] packages to make it easy to open IMAP and SMTP
connections over SSL.  This is a simple "glue" library; all credit for a)
connecting to IMAP/SMTP servers and b) making an SSL connection goes to the
aforementioned libraries.
